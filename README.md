# BuyMe - Online Auction System #
## Description ##
In this project, we have designed and implemented a relational database system to support the operations of an online auction system similar to eBay. We have used HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server.

## Needed tools and installation ##
* JRE, IDE (JAVA, Eclipse for EE developers)
* MySQL
* Apache Tomcat (install it locally in your computer for development purposes)
* JDBC

0. Install MySQL Server 8.0.21 or above on your personal computer. Download MySQL Installer from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/. Launch MySQL workbench to establish a connection to your local MySQL server.
1. Import schema BuyMe in your DB instance using the provided script "BuyMe.sql". Open the script and run it in your MySqlWorkbench (File &rarr; Open SQL script).
2. Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from https://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/.
3. Open Eclipse and import the template project (cs527). <br> (File - Import - General - Existing Projects)
4. Set your Tomcat server in Eclipse
    * If you donâ€™t have Tomcat yet go to: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi and download the binary distribution for your OS.
    * After that go back to Eclipse: <br>
      Windows - Preference - Server - Runtime Environment - Add - Apache Tomcat v8.0 or <br>
      Eclipse - Preferences - Server - Runtime Environments - Add - Apache Tomcat v8.0
5. Connect to your own db instance in Project
    * In order to interact with db instance (add, delete, update, select), you need to set your own database address in the project.
    * At the same time, the database username and password are both essential.
    * Replace the database information with your own database information in ApplicationDB.java file.
6. Run the project based on Tomcat 8 
   (Right click on the project - Run as - Run on Server - Apache - Tomcat8). <br>
   Now you can see your project home page, login.jsp page.
